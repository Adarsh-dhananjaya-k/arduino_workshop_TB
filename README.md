# Arduino Workshop_TB

Welcome to the Arduino Workshop_TB repository. In this README, you will find all the necessary information to get started with Arduino, including downloading the Arduino IDE and the required driver (CH340).

## Download Arduino IDE 1.8.19

To begin your Arduino journey, you'll need to download the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This is where you'll write, compile, and upload your Arduino sketches.

You can download the Arduino IDE 1.8.19 by clicking on the following link: [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Installation

Once you have downloaded the Arduino IDE, you'll need to install it on your computer. Detailed installation instructions for popular operating systems can be found at the following links:

- [Linux Installation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux) (You can also check the [Arduino Playground Linux Guide](https://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/Linux) for additional information).

- [macOS Installation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/macOS)

- [Windows Installation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)

Please follow the appropriate guide for your operating system to complete the installation process.

## Download the Required Driver CH340

In some cases, you may need to download the CH340 driver to enable communication with your Arduino board. The CH340 driver is commonly used for Arduino boards with CH340G USB to UART converters.

You can download the CH340 driver by clicking on the following link: [Download CH340 Driver](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html)

Make sure to follow the instructions provided on the CH340 driver download page to complete the installation.

Once you have the Arduino IDE and CH340 driver installed, you'll be ready to start working with Arduino and embark on your creative projects. Happy coding!
