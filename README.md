# Arduino Workshop_TB

Welcome to the Arduino Workshop_TB repository. This README provides all the necessary information to kick-start your Arduino journey, from downloading the Arduino IDE to installing the required CH340 driver.

## Getting Started

### Download Arduino IDE 1.8.19

To begin your Arduino adventure, you'll need to download the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This is where you'll write, compile, and upload your Arduino sketches.

You can download Arduino IDE 1.8.19 by clicking on the following link: [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

### Installation

Once you've downloaded the Arduino IDE, you'll need to install it on your computer. Detailed installation instructions for popular operating systems can be found at the following links:

- [Linux Installation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux) (You can also refer to the [Arduino Playground Linux Guide](https://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/Linux) for additional information).

- [macOS Installation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/macOS)

- [Windows Installation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)

Please follow the appropriate guide for your operating system to complete the installation process.

### Download the Required Driver CH340

In some cases, you may need to download the CH340 driver to enable communication with your Arduino board, especially if it uses the CH340G USB to UART converter.

You can download the CH340 driver by clicking on the following link: [Download CH340 Driver](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html)

Please follow the instructions provided on the CH340 driver download page to complete the installation.

Once you have the Arduino IDE and CH340 driver installed, you'll be well-equipped to start working with Arduino and begin your creative projects. Happy coding!
