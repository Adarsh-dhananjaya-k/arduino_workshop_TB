# Steps for Connecting the Circuit

Follow these steps to set up the circuit for your Arduino board:

**Step 0: Select the Appropriate Arduino Board**

1. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
2. Before proceeding, ensure that you've selected the correct Arduino board from the "Tools" menu.
   - If you are using an Arduino Nano, select "Arduino Nano" from the "Tools" > "Board" menu.
   - If you are using an Arduino Uno, select "Arduino Uno" from the "Tools" > "Board" menu.

**Step 1: Connect the Anode of the LED to Pin 5**

1. Take an LED.
2. Identify the longer leg of the LED; this is the anode (positive).
3. Connect a jumper wire to the anode of the LED.
4. Connect the other end of the jumper wire to digital pin 5 on the Arduino.

**Step 2: Connect the Cathode of the LED to Ground**

1. Identify the shorter leg of the LED; this is the cathode (negative).
2. Connect a jumper wire to the cathode of the LED.
3. Connect the other end of the jumper wire to one of the Ground (GND) pins on the Arduino.

**Step 3: Upload the Code**

1. Make sure you've selected the correct Arduino board in the "Tools" menu.
2. Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the IDE.
3. Ensure your Arduino board is connected to your computer via USB.
4. Click the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE to upload the code to your Arduino board.

**Step 4: Power on the Arduino**

1. Ensure that your Arduino is powered on and connected to your computer.

**Step 5: Observe the LED Blink**

1. Once you've uploaded the code, the LED should start blinking with a 3-second on and 3-second off pattern.
2. The provided code will turn the LED on for 3 seconds and then turn it off for 3 seconds repeatedly in an infinite loop.
