# Steps for Connecting the Circuit

To make the connections and set up the environment for the code you provided, which is a simple button-controlled LED circuit, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Select the Appropriate Arduino Board**

1. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
2. Before proceeding, ensure that you've selected the correct Arduino board from the "Tools" menu.
   - If you are using an Arduino Nano, select "Arduino Nano" from the "Tools" > "Board" menu.
   - If you are using an Arduino Uno, select "Arduino Uno" from the "Tools" > "Board" menu.

**Step 2: Connect the Button and LED to the Arduino**

1. Connect a button and an LED to the Arduino as follows:
   - Connect one terminal of the button to digital pin 2 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the other terminal of the button to one side of a pull-down resistor (around 10k ohms).
   - Connect the other side of the pull-down resistor to Ground (GND) on the Arduino.
   - Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED to digital pin 11 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the anode (longer leg) of the LED directly to Gnd on the Arduino.

**Step 3: Upload the Code**

1. Make sure you've selected the correct Arduino board in the "Tools" menu.
2. Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the IDE.
3. Make sure your Arduino board is connected to your computer via USB.
4. Click the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE to upload the code to your Arduino board.

**Step 4: Power on the Arduino**

1. Ensure that your Arduino is powered on and connected to your computer.

**Step 5: Observe the Button-Controlled LED**

1. After uploading the code, the LED should turn on when you press the button and turn off when you release it.
2. The code monitors the state of the button, and when it's pressed (buttonState is HIGH), the LED is turned on.

These steps guide you through setting up and using the button-controlled LED circuit with your Arduino, ensuring that you've selected the correct board and have made the necessary connections.
